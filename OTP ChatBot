Ask chatbot for the flag.

Source: chatbot.py


hint 1: https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/388.pdf section 3.1
hint 2: rsa is actually crt over 2 big primes, but it isn't restricted to only 2. also note that flag^d is independent from modulo, finally, we only need to consider small prime factors. good luck
